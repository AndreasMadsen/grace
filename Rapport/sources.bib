  title = {Least Squares Adjustment: Linear and Nonlinear Weighted Regression
	Analysis},
  month = {sep},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {This note primarily describes the mathematics of least squares regression
	analysis as it is often used in geodesy including land surveying
	and satellite based positioning applications. In these fields regression
	is often termed adjustment. The note also contains a couple of typical
	land surveying and satellite positioning application examples. In
	these application areas we are typically interested in the parameters
	of the model (often {2-} or {3-D} positions) and their uncertainties
	and not in predictive modelling which is often the main concern in
	other regression analysis applications.
	
	Adjustment is often used to obtain estimates of relevant parameters
	in an over-determined system of equations which may arise from deliberately
	carrying out more measurements than actually needed to determine
	the set of desired parameters. An example may be the determination
	of a geographical position based on information from a number of
	Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites also known as
	space vehicles (SV). It takes at least four SVs to determine the
	position (and the clock error) of a {GNSS} receiver. Often more than
	four SVs are used and we use adjustment to obtain a better estimate
	of the geographical position (and the clock error) and to obtain
	estimates of the uncertainty with which the position is determined.
	
	Regression analysis is used in many other fields of application both
	in the natural, the technical and the social sciences. Examples may
	be curve fitting, calibration, establishing relationships between
	different variables in an experiment or in a survey, etc. Regression
	analysis is probably one the most used statistical techniques around.
	Dr. Anna B. O. Jensen provided insight and data for the Global Positioning
	System (GPS) example.
	
	Matlab code and sections that are considered as either traditional
	land surveying material or as advanced material are typeset with
	smaller fonts.
	
	Comments in general or on for example unavoidable typos, shortcomings
	and errors are most welcome.},

	The data consist of gravity data in the form of 10-day maximum values

	at 29 July 2002 and ending at 25 August 2010. Results focussing on

	inland ice melt-off to the {SE} and {NW} with an acceleration in
	the melt-off occurring to the {NW} and a possible deceleration to
	the {SE}. Also, there are strong indications of a transition taking
	place in the mass loss in Greenland from mid-2004 to early 2006.},
