\section{Conclusion}

The main purpose of this report was to describe mass losses or gains at the South Coast of Greenland (SC) and Western Antarctica (WA). Both locations were found to be losing mass. Both location had periodic trends, but while SC had soft oscillating curves WA's mass loss was more jagged  this might suggests that ice is melting and breaking of in a more unstable pattern. However, overall it was found that ice at the two locations was melting with approximately the same speed and with a slight difference in acceleration.
