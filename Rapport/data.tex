\section{Data}

The GRACE dataset can be downloaded from GRGS \cite{GRACE-data-source}.
This report is based on the Equivalent Water Height (denoted EWH) dataset from release 2 in the GRGS format with a 10-day interval.

This dataset contains quite a few text files, each containing information in both its filename and its content.
The filenames have the format:

\begin{lstlisting}
grid.water.10day_model_minus_RL02MF.19202_19211.txt
grid.water.10day_model_minus_RL02MF.19212_19221.txt
...
\end{lstlisting}

In the filename, the last two numbers (e.g. \texttt{19202\_19211}) there are important.
These numbers contains the start and end date for the file content.
Both numbers are the amount of days since ``1950-01-01'', where the first number denotes the start date and the last number the end date of the period for the measurements. \cite{GRACE-data-format-dates}

The actual content of each text file should be read as a ``Space Separated Values'' format.
When this is done one will have a $6480 \times 10$ matrix. 
This matrix can then be \texttt{reshape}'ed row-wise intro a $180 \times 360$ matrix.
The result is a matrix with decreasing latitude on the rows and increasing longitude on the columns. \cite{GRACE-data-format-grids}

\end{figure}

From Figure \ref{fig:data-example-world} a local mass loss at Greenland and the South Pole is seen, this is likely caused by the ice melting.
A mass increment in South America can also been seen, this is likely caused by the rain season.
On Figure \ref{fig:data-example-scatter}, mass loss with a yearly periodic trend is seen.
