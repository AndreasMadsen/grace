\subsection{Glacial Isostatic Adjustment}

The GRACE data that has been used in this report has not been corrected for Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), also called post-glacial rebound.

GIA is an geophysical effect that makes land either rise, fall or shift horizontally. 
It can be observed at all locations which during the last ice age was covered by a thick layer of ice.
The cause is the sheer weight of the ice compressed the crust of the Earth so much, that when the ice retracted and the downward force was removed the crust started to rebound.
It is estimated that these movements will take many thousand years to subside.

\end{figure}

The GRACE data only measures the gravity and because of the geophysical effect the rebound will be part of the observations.
Thus one can not directly conclude from the GRACE data, if changes are caused by recent ice melting or GIA. Removing the GIA signal is therefore important, if one wants to assert that ice indeed is melting.

Even though there appears to be a significant velocity in EWH after GIA has been removed from the velocity estimate, one still has to be careful about making conclusions. According to NASA \cite{NASA-GIA-incomplete}, in order to sufficiently correct for GIA, region specific averaging kernels are needed to properly account for GIA as well as noise from nearby land hydrology.

NASA specifically state \cite{NASA-GIA-incomplete} that the GRACE data (with standard GIA applied) is not suited for Cryospheric studies (ice mass changes) and thus one should keep these reservations in mind when viewing the results.

\textit{For the remaining report no correction for GIA has been used. Only this section uses the standard GIA correction.}
