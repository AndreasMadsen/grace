Understanding the effect of global warming is important for predicting the future of the globe.
As the temperature of the globe increases, ice melts and water flows into the oceans.
This report analyses local mass losses on the Earth's surface which could be caused by glaciers turning into water.
Several different  approaches such as Ordinary Least Squares, autocorrelated OLS, basis expansion and Principle Component Analysis were used.

These methods lead to estimate of velocity and acceleration of the mass loss in which it was found that the West and East coast of Greenland as well as Western Antarctica are losing mass the fastest as well as also having the largest acceleration of mass loss. Surprisingly while the largest velocity in Greenland was found on the East Coast, the West Coast was found to have a higher acceleration.

Unsupervised clustering methods were also used and a Gaussian mixture model chained with kernel PCA gave amazing results. The results corresponds well to the velocity estimates and also revealed other interesting geophysiological phenomena.
